# challenge-eighteen-peacock
Repository for challenge 18 of my bootcamp. Was tasked with creating a social network API that was initiated from the command line, primarily using express.js and mongodb.


for add a reaction, i need to get thgought, add or update reactions object wither using an array method or some mongoose method. This is because reactions is an array of objects (findoneandupdate is similar)
reading all mini projects will be the best way to complete this
check out thought controller.js line 69
reactions is not a model but a schema, similar to the replies in the pizza hunt app.
thought is pizza,
reactions are comments but function similarly to replies?

might just turn this in and see what feedback i get back
