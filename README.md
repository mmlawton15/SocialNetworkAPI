# challenge-eighteen-peacock
Repository for challenge 18 of my bootcamp. Was tasked with creating a social network API that was initiated from the command line, primarily using express.js and mongodb.

## What is this?
This is my submission for challenge 18 of my bootcamp. I was give the assignment to start the backend code for a social media platform that is being developed. The users are able to post thoughts, and react to their friends thoughts as well. The users also will be able to add or delete friends, add or delete reactions, and add or delete thoughts.

## How did I build this?
I built this using Javascript, Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB and NoSQL. I really enjoyed the project overall, even through the complexities of connecting the dots.

## Where can I find it?
